## Descriptive analysis (my summary)
Types of data analysis  
- descriptive; describe/summarize  
- exploratory; examine and find unknown relations  
Correlation is different from causation!!!!  
- inferential; use small set to 'predict' large set  
Depending on sampling choice
- predictive; use current and historical to predict future  
- causal analysis --> GOLD!! (Bell Curve)  
- mechanistic analysis; exact change in one variable leads to exact changes in other variables  


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
